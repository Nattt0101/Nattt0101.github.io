            1. Definitions & Interpretation
            <br>
            Unless otherwise defined, the definitions and provisions in respect of interpretation set out in Schedule 1 will apply to these Terms & Conditions of Sale.
            <br>
            2. Purchase of Products
            <br>
            2.1 Your Compliance: You agree to comply with any and all the guidelines, notices, operating rules and policies and instructions pertaining to the purchase of Products through the Platform, as well as any amendments to the aforementioned, issued by NPShop (whether as part of use of the Platform or in relation to the purchase of Products, on behalf of Seller), from time to time. NPShop reserves the right to revise these guidelines, notices, operating rules and policies and instructions at any time and you are deemed to be aware of and bound by any changes to the foregoing upon their publication on the Platform.
            <br>
            2.2 Product Description: While Seller endeavours to provide an accurate description of the Products, neither NPShop nor Seller warrants that such description is accurate, current or free from error. In the event that the Product you receive is of a fundamentally different nature from the Product as described on the Platform and which you have ordered, Clause 6 of these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop shall apply.
            <br>
            2.3 Sellers: Products are sold by “Sellers”. NPShop may be a “Seller” for selected Products. “Seller” may also refer to a party other than NPShop (such party referred to in these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop as a “Third Party Vendor”). Whether a particular Product is listed for sale on the Platform by NPShop or a Third Party Vendor may be stated on the webpage listing that Product. Products sold to you by Sellers will be governed by individual Customer Contracts (more details below in Clause 2.6) which:
            <br>
            2.3.1 for Products sold by Third Party Vendors, shall be agreements entered into directly and only between the Third Party Vendor and you; and
            <br>
            2.3.2 for Products sold by NPShop, shall be agreements entered into directly and only between NPShop and you.
            <br>
            2.4 Placing your Order: You may place an Order by completing the Order form on the Platform and clicking on the “Place my Order” button. Seller will not accept Orders placed in any other manner. You shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Order.
            <br>
            2.5 Orders are irrevocable and unconditional: All Orders will be deemed to be irrevocable and unconditional upon transmission through the Platform and Seller shall be entitled (but not obliged) to process such Order(s) without your further consent and without any further reference or notice to you. Nevertheless, in certain circumstances as stated in Clause 8, you may request to cancel or amend the Order which Seller will endeavour to give effect to on a commercially reasonable effort basis. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller is not obliged to give effect to any request to cancel or amend any Order.
            <br>
            2.6 Seller’s reservation of rights in respect of Orders: All Orders shall be subject to Seller’s acceptance in its sole discretion and each Order accepted by Seller (such accepted Order to be referred to as a “Customer Contract”) shall constitute a separate contract. You acknowledge that unless you receive a notice from Seller accepting your Order, Seller shall not be party to any legally binding agreements or promises made between Seller and you for the sale or other dealings with the Product(s) and accordingly Seller shall not be liable for any Losses which may be incurred as a result. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller reserves the right to decline to process or accept any Order received from or through the Platform in its absolute discretion.
            <br>
            2.7 Product Warranty: The warranties with respect to a Product (“Product Warranty”) sold under a Customer Contract shall be as stated by Seller via the Platform, under the “Specifications” tab in the fields “Warranty Type” and “Warranty Period” for the relevant Product, and shall be limited by the terms and conditions therein. The warranties and conditions, remedies for breach of warranty or condition, or other terms stated in the Product Warranty are, unless expressly prohibited by applicable mandatory law, in lieu of all other terms, warranties and conditions, whether expressed or implied, statutory or otherwise. Except as expressly provided in such Product Warranty, Seller excludes (unless expressly prohibited by applicable mandatory law) all other express or implied terms, warranties or conditions with respect to the Products supplied.
            <br>
            2.8 Customer’s Acknowledgement: You acknowledge and warrant that you have not relied on any term, condition, warranty, undertaking, inducement or representation made by or on behalf of Seller which has not been stated expressly in a Customer Contract or upon any descriptions or illustrations or specifications contained in any document including any catalogues or publicity material produced by either NPShop or Seller. You also acknowledge and agree that the exclusion of warranties, exclusion of liability and exclusion of remedies in these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop and Customer Contracts allocate risks between the parties and permit Seller to provide the Products at lower fees or prices than Seller otherwise could and you agree that such exclusions on liability are reasonable.
            <br>
            2.9 No representations or warranties: Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing Clause 2.9:
            <br>
            2.9.1 no condition is made or to be implied nor is any warranty given or to be implied as to the life or wear of the Products supplied or that they will be suitable for any particular purpose or use under any specific conditions, notwithstanding that such purpose or conditions may be known or made known to Seller;
            <br>
            2.9.2 Seller binds itself only to deliver Products in accordance with the general description under which they were sold, whether or not any special or particular description shall have been given or shall be implied by law. Any such special or particular description shall be taken only as the expression of Seller's opinion in that behalf. Neither NPShop nor Seller gives any warranty as to the quality, state, condition or fitness of the Products;
            <br>
            2.9.3 NPShop shall be under no liability for the following measures and actions taken by the Customer or third parties and the consequences thereof: improper remedy of defects, alteration of the Products without the prior agreement of NPShop, addition and insertion of parts, in particular of spare parts which do not come from NPShop;
            <br>
            2.9.4 Seller shall be under no liability in respect of any defect arising from unsuitable or improper use, defective installation or commissioning by the Customer or third parties, fair wear and tear, wilful damage, negligence, abnormal working conditions, defective or negligent handling, improper maintenance, excessive load, unsuitable operating materials and replacement materials, poor work, unsuitable foundation, chemical, electro-technical/electronic or electric influences, the Customer or third parties’ failure to follow NPShop's instructions (whether oral or in writing) misuse or alteration or repair of the Products without NPShop's approval;
            <br>
            2.9.5 Seller is not liable for any Losses suffered by any third party directly or indirectly caused by repairs or remedial work carried out without NPShop's prior written approval and the Customer shall indemnify Seller against all Losses arising out of such claims;
            <br>
            2.9.6 Seller shall be under no liability under the above warranty (or any other warranty, condition or guarantee) if the total price for the Products has not been paid in cleared funds by the due date for payment; and
            <br>
            2.9.7 Seller shall be under no liability whatsoever in respect of any defect in the Products arising after the expiry of the applicable Product Warranty, if any.
            <br>
            2.10 Intellectual Property:
            <br>
            2.10.1 Unless the prior written consent of NPShop has been obtained, the Customer shall not remove or alter the trade marks, logos, copyright notices, serial numbers, labels, tags or other identifying marks, symbols or legends affixed to any Products.
            <br>
            2.10.2 Where software applications, drivers or other computer programmes and/or all other design details, technical handbooks or manuals, drawing or other data (all collectively referred to as “Product Materials”) are supplied to the Customer by Seller in connection with the Order, the use and retention of the Product Materials are subject to the terms and conditions of licence or use (such as end-user licences, restrictions or conditions of use) as may be prescribed by Seller or its licensors and must not be used other than strictly in accordance with such terms and conditions.
            <br>
            2.10.3 The Customer agrees and acknowledges that the Product Materials shall remain the property of Seller or its licensors. The Customer further agrees that any and all Intellectual Property embodied in or relating to the Product Materials shall remain the sole and exclusive property of Seller or its licensors. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Order or the prior written consent of NPShop has been obtained, the Customer undertakes to return the Product Materials and/or any copies thereof upon NPShop's request.
            <br>
            3. Delivery of Products
            <br>
            3.1 Address: Delivery of the Products shall be made to the address you specify in your Order either by Seller or by NPShop (or its agents) on behalf of Seller.
            <br>
            3.2 Delivery & packing charges: Delivery and packing charges shall be as set out in the Order.
            <br>
            3.3 Tracking: You may track the status of the delivery at the “Order Tracking” page of the Platform.
            <br>
            3.4 Delivery timeframe: You acknowledge that delivery of the Products is subject to availability of the Products. Seller will make every reasonable effort to deliver the Product to you within the delivery timeframe stated on the relevant page on which the Product is listed, but you acknowledge that while stock information on the Platform is updated regularly, it is possible that in some instances a Product may become unavailable between updates. All delivery timeframes given are estimates only and delays can occur. If the delivery of your Product is delayed Seller will inform you accordingly via e-mail and your Product will be dispatched as soon as it becomes available to Seller. The time for delivery shall not be of the essence, and Seller (nor any of its agents) shall not be liable for any delay in delivery howsoever caused.
            <br>
            3.5 Deemed receipt: In the event you do not receive the Product by the projected delivery date and provided that you inform NPShop within 3 days immediately from such projected delivery date, Seller will try, to the best of Seller’s ability, to locate and deliver the Product. If NPShop does not hear from you within 3 days from such projected delivery date, you shall be deemed to have received the Product.
            <br>
            3.6 Voucher from NPShop: If there is a delay in delivery of the Products, NPShop may in its sole discretion offer a Voucher to the Customer. Upon the acceptance of a Voucher by the Customer, the Customer shall have no further claim against Seller.
            <br>
            3.7 Customer’s failure to take delivery: If the Customer fails to take delivery of the Products (otherwise than by reason of any cause beyond the Customer's reasonable control or by reason of Seller’s fault) then without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Seller, Seller may terminate the Customer Contract.
            <br>
            3.8 Unattended Delivery: NPShop provides the option of having your Products left at the Customer’s doorstep, or as otherwise instructed by the Customer, as an “Unattended Delivery.” Please note that some orders will not be eligible for Unattended Delivery. While NPShop’s goal is to honour the Customer’s preferences whenever possible, NPShop is unable to guarantee that NPShop (or our agents) will be able to meet these instructions under all circumstances. If the Customer selected for an Unattended Delivery and no one is available to accept the delivery of the Products, NPShop (or our agents) will leave the Customer’s Products unattended on or in front of the Customer’s premises, or as instructed. Where the Customer specifically instructs NPShop (or our agents) to leave the Customer’s Products outside the door, or as instructed by the Customer, of the specified delivery address, such delivery (including unattended alcohol) shall be at the Customer’s sole risk and the Customer accepts all liability and risk of loss, theft, and damage.
            <br>
            4. Prices of Products
            <br>
            4.1 Listing Price: The price of the Products payable by a Customer shall be the Listing Price at the time at which the Order placed by the Customer is transmitted to Seller (through the Platform).
            <br>
            4.2 Taxes: All Listing Prices are subject to taxes, unless otherwise stated. Seller reserves the right to amend the Listing Prices at any time without giving any reason or prior notice.
            <br>
            5. Payment
            <br>
            5.1 General: You may pay for the Product using any of the payment methods prescribed by NPShop from time to time. When you place an Order, actual payment will be only charged upon Seller’s acceptance of your Order and formation of a Customer Contract. All payments shall be made to NPShop, either accepting payment in its own right or as Seller’s agent (where Seller is a Third Party Vendor). You acknowledge that NPShop is entitled to collect payments from you on behalf of Third Party Vendors.
            <br>
            5.2 Additional Terms: The payment methods may be subject to additional terms as prescribed by NPShop from time to time.
            <br>
            5.3 Payment Methods: You agree that you are subject to the applicable user agreement of your payment method. You may not claim against Seller or any of its agents (which may include NPShop), for any failure, disruption or error in connection with your chosen payment method. NPShop reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any payment method without notice to you or giving any reason.
            <br>
            The goods and services eligible for purchase via PayNow are subject to change in NPShop’s sole discretion. If your order contains ineligible items, please select another valid payment method e.g. credit card, to pay for the order.
            <br>
            Failure to pay: If the Customer fails to make any payment pursuant to the terms and conditions of the payment method elected or payment is cancelled for any reason whatsoever, then without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to Seller, Seller shall be entitled to cancel the Customer Contract or suspend delivery of the Products until payment is made in full.
            <br>
            11. General
            <br>
            11.1 References to “NPShop”: References to “NPShop” in these Terms and Conditions of Sale for NPShop apply both to NPShop’s actions on its own behalf as Seller and/or as the operator of the Platform or as the agent of Third Party Vendors as Sellers in respect of each and every Customer Contract.
            <br>
            11.2 The rights and protections conferred on NPShop under these Terms and Conditions of Sale for NPShop shall be additional to the rights and protections conferred on NPShop under the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy as well as such other terms and conditions as may be agreed to or accepted by the Customer.
            <br>
            11.3 Any clause in the Terms and Conditions of Sale for NPShop, Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and other terms and conditions as may be agreed to or accepted by the Customer that is invalid, unenforceable or illegal shall be enforced as nearly as possible in accordance with its terms, but shall otherwise be deemed severed and shall not affect the enforceability of any other clauses, which clauses shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.
            <br>
            11.4 NPShop reserves the right to alter, modify, add to or otherwise vary these Terms and Conditions of Sale for NPShop from time to time, and in such manner as NPShop deems appropriate. The Customer shall be bound by the terms and conditions so amended. In any event, if the Customer continues to use the Services provided by NPShop after such amendment, the Customer shall be deemed to have accepted the amendments.
            <br>
            11.5 Cumulative Rights and Remedies: Unless otherwise provided under these Terms & Conditions of Sale, the provisions of these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop and Seller’s rights and remedies under these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop are cumulative and are without prejudice and in addition to any rights or remedies Seller may have in law or in equity, and no exercise by Seller of any one right or remedy under these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop, or at law or in equity, shall (save to the extent, if any, provided expressly in these Terms & Conditions of Sale for NPShop or at law or in equity) operate so as to hinder or prevent Seller’s exercise of any other such right or remedy as at law or in equity.
            <br>
            11.6 Correction of Errors: Any typographical, clerical or other error or omission in any acceptance, invoice or other document on Seller’s part shall be subject to correction without any liability on Seller’s part.
