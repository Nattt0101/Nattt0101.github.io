Assignment 2
For the checkpoint 1, we have created the various html, css and javascript. We have decided to add the navigation bar on all the html except for login.html and signup.html because those 2 html will be for user to create or sign in their account to continue using the website. We have implemented a few features such as games (random gift generator), flip card for the contact and many other features. We have also created the wireframes for the html in both desktop and mobile view.
